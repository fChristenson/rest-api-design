## Notes

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architecture for web
API design.

The base idea is to put a thin layer of logic on top of the database where
through the webserver the client can perform controlled updates to the database.

Things are rarely this simple and most professional grade servers break
the REST practices in favour of more pragmatic approaches but even so the 
base design is very dependable.
